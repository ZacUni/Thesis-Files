Many people use showers to get clean. Often, a person will say, “I’m going to take a shower.” That means, I am going to use the shower. Soon, I will be learning to take a shower. What follows is a list of steps that many people follow to take a shower at home. It is a list of what they do and why they do it. TEN STEPS TO TAKE A SHOWER • Go into the bathroom and close the door. Closing the door keeps a shower private. • Take off clothes. This keeps clothes dry. • Turn on the water and set a comfortable water temperature. If the water is too hot or too cold, a shower is uncomfortable. (Hint: Some people use the bathtub faucet to make sure the water temperature is comfortable, and then they send the water through the shower head.) • Make sure the water is coming out through the shower head. • Step carefully into the shower. Wet surfaces may be slippery. • Wash hair with shampoo, rinse, apply conditioner, rinse. Shampoo is soap made just for washing hair. Conditioner makes hair easier to comb and style. Rinsing well after the shampoo and conditioner is important for clean and comfortable hair and scalp. • Wash skin with soap. This gets a body clean. Rinse. Rinsing well is important for clean and comfortable skin. • When the shower is done, turn off the water. This saves water and energy. • Use a towel to dry skin and hang up the towel. Dry skin makes clean clothes feel more comfortable. Hanging up the towel keeps the bathroom neat. It also prevents someone from saying, “Hey, come back and hang up your towel.” • Put on clean clothes. Carry dirty clothes out of the bathroom. This helps to keep a bathroom neat.
